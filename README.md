This project aims to implement a secure api rest focused on authentication. Laravel 6 is used, and the laravel/ui package has been reused and adapted to api format.

- This api was thought to be a backend system to serve mobile applications or individual page applications (SPA)
- An api token is delivered every time a login or register is made
